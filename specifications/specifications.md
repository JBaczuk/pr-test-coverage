# Code Coverage Pull Request Report

## Summary

I need a github action adds and updates a comment on a PR a summary of the full test coverage of the entire codebase as well as a summary of the coverage of the changed files. It should also include a table with a coverage report of each changed file.

## Requirements
1. The action should be named `pr-test-coverage`.
2. The action should be versioned using semantic versioning.
3. The action should add a comment to the PR on first run.
4. The action should update the comment on subsequent runs unless the `update-comment` input is set to `false`, in which case it should add a new comment.
5. The action uses an LCOV report to generate the coverage report. It takes a LCOV report file path as input parameter `lcov-file`.
6. Create a README.md in the root of the repository with instructions on how to use the action. It should also include example output using a fictitious LCOV report not the example I give below in this prompt. It should include the permissions required:
```yaml
permissions: 
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```
7. The action should add a comment to the PR with the summary of the full test coverage of the entire codebase as well as a summary of the coverage of the changed files. It should also include a table with the coverage of each changed file with the following columns:
- Lines
- Line Coverage
- Functions
- Function Coverage
- Branches
- Branch Coverage
8. Optionally the action should fail if the coverage of the changed files is below the `changed-files-minimum-coverage` input parameter.
9. Optionally the action should fail if the coverage of the entire codebase is below the `all-files-minimum-coverage` input parameter.
10. Optionally the action should upload the coverage report as an artifact if the `artifact-name` input parameter is set using the value of the `artifact-name` input parameter as the artifact name.
11. Optionally the action should use the `working-directory` input parameter to specify the working directory. Default: empty (repository root)
12. The report should include the full path of each file, ordered by directory, and should include coverage of each directory where files were changed.

## Example Workflow
```yaml
- uses: jbaczuk/pr-test-coverage@v1
  with:
    # Lcov file location. For example, coverage/lcov.info
    lcov-file: coverage/lcov.info

    # Github token required for getting list of changed files and posting comments
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    
    # Working directory
    # Default: empty (repository root)
    working-directory:

    # All files minimum coverage in percentage. For example, 0, 50, 100
    # Default: 0
    all-files-minimum-coverage:

    # Changed files minimum coverage in percentage. For example, 0, 50, 100
    # Default: 0
    changed-files-minimum-coverage:

    # Artifact name of the generated html. Requires LCOV to be installed
    # Default: empty (skip uploading artifact)
    artifact-name:

    # Update comment
    # Default: true
    update-comment:
```
